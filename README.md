## Simple bank service

It will provide APIs for the frontend to do the following things:

1. Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of the owner’s name, balance, and currency.
2. Record all balance changes to each of the accounts. So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, an account entry record will be created.
3. Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This should happen within a transaction, so that either both accounts’ balances are updated successfully or none of them are.
